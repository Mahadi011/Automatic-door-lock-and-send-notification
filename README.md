# Automatic-door-lock-and-send-notification
Now a days home security is very important in our life. Specially when you have Young teenager. Very often we have to be away from home due to our work, it would be great if we could receive some kind of notification when someone come home or when the last person go out from home.My model is to send notification when someone will come home and also send notification when the last person will go out from home and lock the door automatically.

Here I use SIM 900 GSM module to send notification to the cell phone. In my code I used LCD screen insted to show the massage notification.

Here I took 2 motion sensors name "out" and "in" when someone will come at home "out" sensor will activate and each time "out" sensor is activated person count will increase by 1. When person count is 1 it will send the notification to the cell that "SOMEONE AT HOME". When someone will go out from home then in sensor will activate and each time it will activate person count will decrease by 1. So when person count is 0 then it will lock the door and send the notification to cell that

"HOME IS EMPTY"
"DOOR IS LOCKED"
